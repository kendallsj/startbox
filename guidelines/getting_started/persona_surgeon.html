                <li>MD orthopedic surgeon for 18 years</li>

            <h4>Goals:</h4>
            <ul>
           <li>Help educate patients so they can understand their injuries and what is causing them pain</li>
<li>Recommend a course of action, whether it be surgery, exercise, or otherwise to help fix the problem</li>
<li>Make sure the patients are getting the proper care leading up to, during, and after their procedure(s)

</ul>


            <h4 class="pad-top-20 pad-bottom-20">Typical Day:</h4>
<p>She often works a 10-12 hour day. Some days she is at the clinical office diagnosing and educating patients. Shortly after, she will dictate the patient demographics and procedure, handing it off to a nurse or scribe to enter it into the EHR. Other days she will go to a hospital or surgery center to make final verifications with patients in pre-op before performing surgery on them.</p>

<h4 class="pad-top-20 ">Pain Points:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Finds it difficult to dictate notes after confirming the procedure with the patient</li>
<li>Using multiple applications to enter and dictate and notes</li>
<li>Sometimes learns the procedure/laterality is incorrect in pre-op, right before surgery</li>

</ul>
