            <h3>Overview:</h3>
            <p>Dr. Norton has been a general practitioner, with a speciality in emergency
            medicine, for the past 24 years. The majority of his career has been in the
            ER, although he got worn down by the schedule and moved to an urgent
            care center a few years ago. He is a huge champion for patient safety and
            quality, and treating the patient so they are in and out as fast as possible.</p>

            <p>A colleague of his recommended telehealth. Excited about what
technology could do to solve some of the process problems existing in
healthcare now, Dr. Norton explored the option of telehealth further. He
has now been a telehealth provider for the past 2 years. Initially he had
around 150 consultations a month, but is currently well into 400 - 600
consults. Now, Dr. Norton works mainly as a telehealth provider and
works a few days a week at the urgent care center. He likes the flexibility
telehealth provides, but still has some issues with the system.</p>

          <p>Dr. Norton has a very active life and often takes consultations on the go.
However, the platform does not allow him to see his availability on his
existing calendar because the two calendars don’t synch. He holds most of
his sessions via telephone because video takes more time to set up and the
software is often an issue. Many video sessions are dropped and he spends
too much time trying to reconnect with patients, impacting patient care
and possibly causing him to miss out on potential revenue from other
patients in need of assistance. He thinks telephone sessions are very
effective and allows him to deliver the same level of care as video, so he is
not compelled to make himself available for video sessions.</p>
