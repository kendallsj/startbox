            <h4>Goals:</h4>
            <ul>
           <li>Wants to grow her personal training business, and maybe hire a couple of new employees</li>
<li>Doing research to keep her knowledge of proper nutrition and fitness up-to-date</li>
<li>Keeping a healthy relationship with her family</li>

</ul>


            <h4 class="pad-top-20 pad-bottom-20">Typical Day:</h4>
<p>Patty typically wakes up at 5 am and runs 3 miles before coming home for breakfast and going to work. She often works 8 or 9 hours a day, 5 days a week. She normally sees 6-8 clients per day, and they are often times older individuals. Lately her stomach has been causing her pain, and her surgeon has determined that she will need surgery to have it removed. She is nervous because she’s never had surgery before, and she’s concerned what will happen prior to and during the surgery.</p>

<h4 class="pad-top-20 ">Pain Points:</h4>
<ul>
<li>She has to fill out several forms at hospital registration</li>
<li>She is concerned about being unconscious during the procedure</li>
<li>She is annoyed with how many times her information is being verified, although she’d rather be safe than sorry</li>

</ul>
