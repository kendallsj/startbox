            <h4>Goals:</h4>
            <ul>
           <li>Help educate patients during pre-op to make sure they understand the procedure process and preparation</li>
<li>Keeping a clear and focused mind while on the job, to avoid errors/complications during surgery</li>
<li>Provide better care for patients through efficient use of technology</li>
</ul>


            <h4 class="pad-top-20 pad-bottom-20">Typical Day:</h4>
<p>Nathan typically works a 10-12 hour day. He spends some time prepping patients in different pre-op rooms, as well as assessing each patient’s information and procedure prior to and post surgery. More often, he is in the OR during surgery, monitoring vital signs, watching for complications, controlling bleeding, suturing wounds, etc. in order to aid the surgeon in performing his/her duties.</p>

<h4 class="pad-top-20 ">Pain Points:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Mandatory overtime due to lack of available staff puts a strain on patient care and productivity</li>
<li>Excessive data entry</li>
<li>Internet connectivity issues, especially in the OR</li>
<li>Lack of integration with different systems within and across facilities</li>
</ul>
